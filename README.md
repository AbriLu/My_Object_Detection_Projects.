# My_Object_Detection_Projects.
This project consists of a number of mini-projects focused on the field of machine learning, more specifically, computer vision.
With this project, I intend to learn how to use the YOLO computer-vision package for object detection and implementation in cars or people counting systems.
This will eventually require me to implement object tracking using different Python packages as well.
I am really having fun learning, and I hope to further my knowledge in the field of machine learning through the implementation of these projects
Enjoy! and feel free to suggest improvements/contribute.
